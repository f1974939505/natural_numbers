# natural_numbers
This code is to demonstrate in a python way how to define natural numbers.



ZFC Axiomatic Set Theory defines a well-ordered set called the class of ordinals.

The ordinals α in such class are all sets, ordered by the binary relationship "∈" (i.e. "α∈β" indicates that α is before β in the order),

and defined with the recurrence relationship "α + 1 = α ∪ {α}" initiated with "0 = ∅".

Therefore, finite recurrences define finite ordinals, aka natural numbers, as shown in "main.py" ("{" and "}" are replaced by "[" and "]", respectively),

and it is found that all natural numbers equal the union of ordinals from 0 to themselves,

which induces the union of all natural numbers, a transfinite ordinal ω.
